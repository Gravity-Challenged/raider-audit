## Hungering Destroyer

### Pull 17

#### Death from Volatile Ejection at 00:14
- Facing towards group to try to position so he didn't overlap anyone but had no where to go.

### Summary

Unsure why he ran along the ranged side to clear curse, but luckily it was in between Black Wings casts.  His death on this pull is understandable.
